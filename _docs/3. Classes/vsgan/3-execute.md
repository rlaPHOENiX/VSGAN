Executes the ESRGAN model on `n`th frame from `clip`. This function is mainly intended to be used internally.
It isn't an error to use this function, but perhaps you're looking for [VSGAN.run]({{ '/classes/vsgan/run/' | absolute_url }}).

- `n (int)`: Frame number.
- `clip (VideoNode)`: Clip to get the frame from.
